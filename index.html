            Quad, the grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia reaffirmed its “steadfast commitment” to a free and open Indo-Pacific. It vowed to work towards a region where no country dominates another and every country is free from "coercion". After a meeting of the foreign ministers of the member countries on Monday, the alliance, which was formed to challenge China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, decided to expand its ambitious Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) programme to the Indian Ocean region that would facilitate monitoring strategic waters. Meanwhile, China accused the Quad countries of "scaremongering, inciting antagonism and confrontation".

            In Sri Lanka, Sairaj Bahutule is currently part of the Indian team management as a bowling coach, a decision taken with regard to spin-friendly surfaces in the country. It is unclear whether Bahutule will stay with the side following Morkel's potential arrival; the South African doesn't hold particular expertise in spin-bowling assistance. With five of India's Tests in the ongoing World Test Championship cycle to take place in home conditions, it will be interesting to see whether the team management would stick with Bahutule or transition to the star former South African pacer.
